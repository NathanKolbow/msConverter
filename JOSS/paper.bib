 generate samples drawn from a population evolving according to a
 Wright–Fisher neutral model. The program assumes an
 infinite-sites model of mutation, and allows recombination, gene
 conversion, symmetric migration among subpopulations, and a variety
 of demographic histories. The samples produced can be used to
 investigate the sampling properties of any sample statistic under
 these neutral models.Availability: The source code for the program (in the language C)
  is available at http://home.uchicago.edu/~rhudson1/source/mksamples.html.Contact: rr-hudson@uchicago.edu}",
